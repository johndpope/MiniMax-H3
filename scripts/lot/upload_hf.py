# MiniMax-H3 Level-of-Token adapter: {title}

{warnings(repo)}

Research weights for running **MiniMax-H3**'s DiT on a **Level-of-Token (LoT)** layout: fewer, larger tokens where detail is low, with the full-resolution velocity recovered afterwards ([Nakayama et al., arXiv 2610.05816](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.05816)). The VAE latent stays full size; only the transformer sequence shrinks. On one 24 GB card a 37-frame 768×1344 DiT forward measured 51.9 s dense vs 19.6 s LoT (2.64×). The VAE decode is unchanged.

**Status: research.** Coarse regions are still softer than dense H3. Progress, renders and caveats are tracked in [the issue]({ISSUE}).

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `adapter.safetensors` | LoT adapter: per-extent input/output heads, shape MLP, and the Procrustes extent bank (`A`, `s`) it was trained with |
| `lora.safetensors` | Rank-16 LoRA on `blocks.*.attn.qkv_proj`, `attn.out_proj`, `mlp.fc1`, `mlp.fc2` (200 modules) of the FL2VA DiT |
| `train_log.jsonl` | Per-step loss and held-out evals |

## Use

Needs the code in [`scripts/lot`]({CODE}), Fizgig with the LoT hooks (branch `immiscible-h3-noise`), and the pruned int8 FL2VA DiT (`minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors`).

```bash
hf download {repo} --local-dir runs/lot_hf
python3 scripts/lot/render_h3.py --trained runs/lot_hf --swap 4 \\
    --layout bands --variants dense,dense_lora,lot_trained
```

Training from your own mp4s: [cheatsheet]({CODE}/CHEATSHEET.md).

## Training

{settings}

Loss: eq. 17 with H3's `x0 − ε` head (velocity MSE in y-space), plus a distillation term that pulls LoT's clean estimate toward the frozen dense base (LoRA off) from the same noisy input.

## Held-out eval

`dense` / `uniform2` / `mosaic` are the data loss on those layouts. `gap_*` is the weighted distance from LoT to the frozen dense teacher. Lower is better.
